of the supplementary, in the Section "2.3 Checking Assumption 5 for the g-and-k example"

multivariate.transportdistancecomparison.R: computes different transport distances
between samples generated from multivariate Normal distributions, with different
parameters and different dimensions.

multivariate.transportdistancecomparison.plots.R: loads results of above script
to create Figure 4 of the supplementary, in the Section "4. Approximation of the Wasserstein distance
".
